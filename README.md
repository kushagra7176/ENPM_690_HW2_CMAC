ENPM 690 Robot Learning 
@ Author Kushagra Agrawal

I have trained the neural network to follow a 1D function of sin(x). It is programmed for both discrete and continuous inputs.
A total of 35 weights have been taken and the input space is evenly divided in 100 points. 70 points are used for training.
30 points are used for training.

Instructions to run the code:

1.Using Command Prompt:
 
python ...PATH...\ENPM_690_HW2_CMAC\Code\CMAC_discrete.py         // use python3 if using Linux based OS

python ...PATH...\ENPM_690_HW2_CMAC\Code\CMACcontinuous.py
2.Using Spyder or any other IDE:

Open the file and Run.

Special Instructions:

-- Install all package dependencies before running the code.
-- Update pip and all the packages to the latest versions.
